In Wario Bros, players are invited to step into the shoes of Wario, the quintessential anti-hero of the Mario universe. Tired of living in Mario's shadow, Wario is determined to prove his worth and build his own empire, even if it means using unorthodox methods. Unlike Mario, known for his bravery and sense of justice, Wario prefers tough solutions and clever tricks to achieve his goals.

## 🎓 School project
This is our end-of-year project for [l'Université Lumière Lyon 2](https://www.univ-lyon2.fr/).
We had to make a small project in a short space of time in the field we wanted to work in. Both wanting to work in the video game industry, we decided to create a small game using Unreal Engine 5.3.2.
For this project, we decided to put our technical skills and ingenuity to the test, while paying homage to a timeless video game classic: Mario Bros.
